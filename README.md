Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and preprocessed an anime ratings dataset by handling missing values and encoding unique user and anime IDs into numerical indices.

Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for efficient data manipulation.

Model Design and Implementation:

Designed a recommendation model in TensorFlow/Keras with separate embedding layers for users and anime.

Calculated the dot product of flattened user and anime embeddings to predict rating scores.

Compiled the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Split the data into training and testing sets using scikit-learnâ€™s train_test_split.

Trained the model over multiple epochs, monitored performance with validation data, and achieved robust predictions.

Evaluated model performance by computing Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Recommendation Generation:

Implemented a recommendation mechanism that filters out already rated anime and outputs the top 10 recommended anime IDs for a specific user.

Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn

Impact: This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, neural network design, and model evaluation. It showcases the practical application of deep learning techniques in building scalable recommendation systems that can be adapted for various domains.
